// A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. 
// For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is 
// not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.

// Rewrite sumPrimes so it returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to num.

// n is prime if n < 1 && n % 1 === 0 && n % n === 0 && n % x !=== 0 / where x is any other number rather than 1 or n

function sumPrimes(num) {
    return sum;
}

console.log(sumPrimes(10));
